## Description

Hastily thrown together talk on Node.js for GNOCode. Lots of rambling. Too many words.

I am mostly trying to explain how the event loop and async i/o work. How to use them effectively and how to avoid hurting yourself.

Not going to discuss javascript, futures vs. callbacks, flow control, webworkers, etc
